# Welcome to Loom

We're excited to announce Loom, a WASM-first API Gateway designed for the modern cloud-native era.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why Loom?

Traditional API gateways force you to choose between performance and extensibility. Loom changes that with WebAssembly plugins that run at near-native speed.

### Key Features

- **WASM-First** - Write plugins in Rust, Go, or TypeScript
- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Go with no CGO, deploy anywhere
- **HTTP/3 Support** - Modern protocols out of the box
- **AI Gateway** - Built-in LLM routing and token management
- **GraphQL Federation** - Compose multiple GraphQL services

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install Loom
go install github.com/josedab/loom/cmd/loom@latest

# Run with example config
loom -config loom.yaml
```
